##  Description

This logo was designed to reflect the core themes of **DSAMate**:
- **Coding & Problem-Solving:** The subtle binary tree in the background visually ties to the essence of Data Structures and Algorithms.
- **Minimal & Clean:** Each letter (D, S, A) is designed with bold simplicity, avoiding clutter while standing out on a dark background.
- **Creative Vibe:** The glowing effect and blue-white color combo are modern and tech-aligned, helping it stand out.
