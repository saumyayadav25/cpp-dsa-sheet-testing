    <h1>Test POTD Sync Functionality</h1>
    <p>This is a simple test to verify that the POTD sync works correctly.</p>

    <div id="test-results">
      <h2>Test Instructions:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to the DSA sheet page (http://localhost:3000/sheet)</li>
        <li>
          Note the current POTD question and check if it's marked as solved in
          the DSA list
        </li>
        <li>Click "Mark as Done" on the POTD</li>
        <li>
          Verify that the corresponding question in the DSA list is now checked
        </li>
        <li>Refresh the page and verify the sync persists</li>
        <li>
          Verify that checking a DSA question directly does NOT affect the POTD
          status
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Expected Behavior:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          ✅ Marking POTD as done should check the corresponding DSA list
          question
        </li>
        <li>
          ✅ If the same question appears again as POTD on another day, it
          should NOT be auto-marked
        </li>
        <li>
          ✅ Checking a DSA list question directly should NOT affect POTD status
        </li>
        <li>✅ Changes should persist after page refresh</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Test Data Storage:</h2>
      <p>Open browser DevTools -> Application -> Local Storage to see:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>potd_last_done</code> - stores when POTD was last completed
        </li>
        <li><code>potd_streak</code> - stores current streak</li>
        <li>
          <code>dsa-progress</code> - stores DSA question progress with keys
          like "3-7" (topicId-questionId)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <script>
      // Simple JavaScript to help with testing
      console.log("POTD Sync Test Page Loaded");
      console.log("Check localStorage for progress data:");
      console.log("POTD last done:", localStorage.getItem("potd_last_done"));
      console.log("POTD streak:", localStorage.getItem("potd_streak"));
      console.log("DSA progress:", localStorage.getItem("dsa-progress"));
    </script>
