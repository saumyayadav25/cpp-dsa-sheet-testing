# DSA MATE logo in dark variant

# DESCRIPTION

The DSAMATE logo in its dark mode variant features a bold, high-contrast design ideal for modern dark-themed interfaces. Set against a rich black background, the logo showcases the brand name “DSAMATE” in clean, white, uppercase typography. A curved banner frames the text, flanked by symmetrical five-pointed stars on each side, giving it a vintage yet minimal aesthetic. The outer circular emblem adds balance and structure, while the crisp white lines enhance readability and elegance in low-light or dark UI settings. This version is perfect for sleek branding on websites, apps, and digital assets using dark themes.
